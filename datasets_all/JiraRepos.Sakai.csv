61d6a56ff4d395ee2227eafc,57600,"On our instance of Sakai, we were noticing very slow load times for the main forums page.  For a class which had about 4,400 messages, it was taking an average of 27 seconds for the page to load.  Admittedly I think we have speed issues which go way beyond the main forums page, but we still set out to see if we could improve that performance at all.  The result of that work was the patch which I am submitting here for review.  We were able to reduce load time to an average of 5 seconds.  We are currently running this in production with no known outstanding bugs, but please take a look and let me know what you think.\n\nThe patch did a couple things to try to improve speed, but the biggest gain came when I split the one query that used to grab all of the forums, messages, and topics in one query into three separate queries: one to get the data on the topics and forums, one to get the message count for each topic, and one to get the total read message count for each topic for each user.  I think this helped because with one query, we were getting a copy of each forum and each topic for each message.  So in the site with 4000+ messages, the query would return 4,000+ copies of the forums data and 4,000+ copies of the topics' data.\n\nThe other thing I did was to modify Hibernate to use the sort attribute instead of the order-by attribute.  This shaved a couple seconds off of the query speed that was originally running as it was unnecessary to sort all 4000 rows being returned with one order-by clause.  However, in order to fully accommodate this change, I had to modify the API slightly:\norg/sakaiproject/api/app/messageforums/BaseForum.java\n public void setTopicsSet(Set topicsSet) -> public void setTopicsSet(SortedSet topicsSet)\n\nI hope this helps, and please let me know if you see anything I missed or could improve on further.  Thanks.",CLONE -the main forums page loads slowly,,,,

If this is done, and the tool is edited from the Site Editor, the field is a text field, instead of TextArea, and the custom parameters become one entry containing ""<br/>"".\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nThis takes two steps to produce:\r\n    [a] Save custom parameters\r\n    [b] Edit the tool as admin\r\n\r\n[a] Save custom parameters\r\na1.

Press ""Save"" button\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkaround/Solution:\r\nEntering multiple parameters separated by semicolon appears to work fine.  Allowing multi-line entries would require using TextArea in Site Editor, or ""cleaning up"" the entry by replacing ""<br/>"" with semicolons.  Using semicolons will ""mess up"" the view in the TextArea; one workaround for that is to replace semicolons with new lines.\r\n\r\nMy preference would be to either:\r\n[A] Do not have two different forms for editing these parameters\r\nAND/OR\r\n[B] Use one set of input for each parameter instead of TextArea.  Coding this is a little challenging, but not so hard to do.  Add new input fields when the user asks for them, and hide elements when the user asks to delete one.  Some field needs to be sent to the user indicating parameters to delete.  This makes a nice interface.",2+ Custom Parameters Separated by New Lines Broken after Saving sakai.basiclti Tool,,,,

Attached diff file is a patch to remove it.\n\nIssue Description: When the blur() function is called on an element, that element gives up focus. blur() was included in the onchange event for select elements to fix a bug that was present in Netscape 6. Unfortunately, blur() presents problems for keyboard only users. When they change the setting on a select element containing onchange=blur(), focus disappears and (in many browsers), the user has to start navigating through the page's controls from the beginning of the tabindex to navigate to the next control. This is very confusing to screen reader users.\n\nSince it causes accessibility problems, and it is believed that blur() is no longer needed as a fix for the Netscape 6 browser bug, it is suggested that blur() be removed.

61d6a682f4d395ee2228051e,57600,"On our instance of Sakai, we were noticing very slow load times for the main forums page.  For a class which had about 4,400 messages, it was taking an average of 27 seconds for the page to load.  Admittedly I think we have speed issues which go way beyond the main forums page, but we still set out to see if we could improve that performance at all.  The result of that work was the patch which I am submitting here for review.  We were able to reduce load time to an average of 5 seconds.  We are currently running this in production with no known outstanding bugs, but please take a look and let me know what you think.\n\nThe patch did a couple things to try to improve speed, but the biggest gain came when I split the one query that used to grab all of the forums, messages, and topics in one query into three separate queries: one to get the data on the topics and forums, one to get the message count for each topic, and one to get the total read message count for each topic for each user.  I think this helped because with one query, we were getting a copy of each forum and each topic for each message.  So in the site with 4000+ messages, the query would return 4,000+ copies of the forums data and 4,000+ copies of the topics' data.\n\nThe other thing I did was to modify Hibernate to use the sort attribute instead of the order-by attribute.  This shaved a couple seconds off of the query speed that was originally running as it was unnecessary to sort all 4000 rows being returned with one order-by clause.  However, in order to fully accommodate this change, I had to modify the API slightly:\norg/sakaiproject/api/app/messageforums/BaseForum.java\n public void setTopicsSet(Set topicsSet) -> public void setTopicsSet(SortedSet topicsSet)\n\nI hope this helps, and please let me know if you see anything I missed or could improve on further.

Upload spreadsheet that contains the student usernames in the 1st column, and fictional gradebook item header in 2nd column (HW4, for example).\n     2a. in the rows underneath HW4, include at least one cell that contains a value like: 7.48350E+11 (also make sure it is formatted as ""Scientific"" - if the cell is formatted as numeric, Oncourse will indeed give the correct error about only having two decimals places) (sample spreadsheet  .csv is attached)\n3. Upload and import values as normal.\n4. Choose the HW4 column to import.\n5. Give the item a title and relative weight - you do not need to add it to a category; also, the checkboxes about releasing to students/including in course grade don't matter.\n\nSee the attached images for results. Student(s) can have a grade like: 7.4835E11\n\n\n",Percentages Gradebook - Importing Gradebook Item from Spreadsheet with Scientific numbers allows greater than 2 decimal places,,,,

The patch text is available at sourceforge and should be applicable against subsequent versions. This jar is larger than the repository version since debugging symbols have been retained.\n\nSuggestions/Comments:\ni) HSQL needs non-negligable reworking to gain proper timezone support (see sourceforge comment), although the supplied patch solves the problem 99%. Perhaps another database such as CloudScape for the ""QuickStart"" environment might prove more durable and performant. HSQL startup time is already > 7 seconds with the default install on average hardware.\n\nii) Database timestamps are probably an environmental rather than a user (client)-level issue, so perhaps should not be being supplied via API calls. The only possible function is to allow portability of database files to installations in different timezones, but this could be (and probably is already being, in HSQL) achieved by simply storing all timestamps relative to UTC. However, the Sakai usage of JDBC is within the spec and should be being supported by the driver.\n\nMy ""1 minute"" time estimate for this problem is based on a solution involving simply replacing the HSQL jar :P Any of the other resolutions would naturally take somewhat longer...

The SAMigo name change to 'Tests & Quizzes' was specifically to offset user recognition of these two tools based on primary function for that release only.\n\nHowever, since SAMigo is still called 'Samigo' rather than the requested 'Assessments' in the 1.5 integrated release (left nav and tool title iframe), I believe we should pragmatically move to this new title 'Tests & Quizzes' (plural and without '(Samigo)' as that is really only a internal name that won't mean anything to instructors and students) now (or as soon as it can be put in a patch).\n\n","Rename SAMigo tool from ""Quiz and Test"" --> ""Tests & Quizzes""",,,,
