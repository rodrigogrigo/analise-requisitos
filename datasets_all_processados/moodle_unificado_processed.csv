"PayPal IPN Script exposed to message_send() failure The below issue includes the resolution. It merely needs to be marked as fixed and merged in to the main development branch.    The ipn.php script, that is a part of the Paypal enrolment method, makes calls to a function ""message_send"" that can cause the entire PayPal enrolment method to fail.    The ipn script is called by PayPal when a payment has been processed. Paypal calls the script and passes various tokens regarding the transaction. The ipn script:    1) Opens a handle for the paypal connection  2) Evaluates the received tokens and validates them  3) Enrols a student accordingly  4) Notifies the student, instructors & admins via a call to ""message_send()""  5) Closes the connection from paypal    Various people have been reporting that their paypal enrolments work fine for a while, but they start getting these IPN failure warning messages from Paypal. In their IPN history in Paypal, they see a list of failed transactions where the server (moodle) response was a 404.    What's happening for these people, is the 4th step above is failing. The ipn script dies as a product of message_send() failing and the PHP server process would seem to time out and cause the web server to return a 404 to paypal. Since step 3 has been completed, end users of moodle are getting what they need from the plugin. However Paypal doesn't tolerate the 404 responses for long and automatically disables IPN messaging after a while - causing paypal enrolments to fail entirely.    The solution I'm proposing is really simple. I've modified ipn.php to use a wrapper function for message_send that puts the call in try-catch block. This insulates the execution of ipn.php from whatever message_send failures ruining the whole experience. I believe resolving the issue in message_send is another matter (and may merely be a misconfiguration thing - though myself and others do have systems that send us emails successfully, guess those situations aren't depending on the same function).

To illustrate, the contents of the PoodLL filter which fails validation look a bit like this: poodll/lang/en/filter_poodll.php poodll/module.js poodll/pix/download.gif But the ensemble filter zip which passes validation looks like this: ensemble/lang/ ensemble/lang/en/ ensemble/lang/en/filter_ensemble.php ensemble/pix/ ensemble/pix/icon.png The code that does all this in: admin/tool/installaddon/classes/validator.php And the area that needs to be fixed is in function: validate_language_pack"

"Move (non-JS): title attribute is on wrong tag When you are moving items (using the non-AJAX version), the move targets are written out using code like the following:    {code}  <li class=""first movehere"" title=""Move 'AA306 discussion' to this location"">  <a href=""https://learn2acct.open.ac.uk/course/mod.php?movetosection=149146&sesskey=666"">  <img class=""movetarget"" src=""https://learn2acct.open.ac.uk/theme/image.php/ou/core/1383320278/movehere"" title=""Move to here"" alt=""Move to here"">  </a>  </li>  {code}    As you can see, there is a title attribute on the LI tag which does not make a lot of sense. It should be on the link tag. (Additionally, there is an unnecessary title attribute on the img tag.)    This was caused by MDL-37085.    The previous code was:    {code}  <a title=""Move 'AA306 discussion' to this location"" href=""https://learn2.open.ac.uk/course/mod.php?moveto=287791&amp;sesskey=666""><img class=""movetarget"" src=""https://learn2.open.ac.uk/theme/image.php/ou/core/1382685195/movehere"" alt=""Move to here""></a>  {code}    This code is correct, with a title attribute on the A tag containing the full text, and an alt attribute (no title) on the IMG tag.    For accessibility reasons, none of these titles are suitable anyway. All links should have different texts so while the longer text includes the name of the item being moved, that doesn't actually help as it's still the same for all of them. An accessible solution would use text like:    'Move item to Week 4 before ""Study resources""'    In other words, I didn't describe the item being moved (because they probably know, and it's the same for all of them) but I included the section name of the target location and a relative before/after for the position within that section.    I am not sure whether or not it is worth doing anything about this because I know Moodle HQ is planning to stop supporting the non-JS graceful degradation features. I was thinking about fixing the regression and putting it back to have the right attribute on the right tag, but since it's inaccessible even after doing that (and always was), I don't think I am going to bother...

It should be on the link tag. (Additionally, there is an unnecessary title attribute on the img tag.) This was caused by MDL-37085. The previous code was: {code}  {code} This code is correct, with a title attribute on the A tag containing the full text, and an alt attribute (no title) on the IMG tag. For accessibility reasons, none of these titles are suitable anyway. All links should have different texts so while the longer text includes the name of the item being moved, that doesn't actually help as it's still the same for all of them. An accessible solution would use text like: 'Move item to Week 4 before ""Study resources""' In other words, I didn't describe the item being moved (because they probably know, and it's the same for all of them) but I included the section name of the target location and a relative before/after for the position within that section. I am not sure whether or not it is worth doing anything about this because I know Moodle HQ is planning to stop supporting the non-JS graceful degradation features. I was thinking about fixing the regression and putting it back to have the right attribute on the right tag, but since it's inaccessible even after doing that (and always was), I don't think I am going to bother...

get_child_contexts() returns invalid contexts when context path missing This problem was reported by partner. The trouble is that for various reasons the context path may be missing which results in invalid SQL like path selector in get_child_contexts() - we need to verify the path is valid before using it. The problem is that the get_child_contexts() may be used when deleting data which resulted in deletion of all contexts in several existing sites when using some add-ons...    Short term solution:  # print debugging message when get_child_contexts() on contexts that do not have path or depth and return empty array  # prevent deleting of system context    Long term solution (new issue to be created):  * prevent deleting of invalid contexts in UI  * add CLI tool for diagnostics and rebuilding of context paths  * add more debugging notices to inform admins that there is something wrong with contexts  * add more debugging info for admins that try to insert data directly to database tables without rebuilding the contexts  * maybe add workaround code for invalid contexts that tries to lookup children using some other info    ,4,MDL-43367,moodle,get_child_contexts return invalid context context path miss problem report partner trouble reason context path miss result invalid sql like path selector get_child_contexts need verify path valid problem get_child_contexts delete datum result deletion context exist site add ons short term solution print debug message get_child_contexts context path depth return array prevent deleting system context long term solution new issue create prevent deleting invalid context ui add cli tool diagnostic rebuilding context path add debugging notice inform admin wrong contexts add debugging info admin try insert datum directly database table rebuild context maybe add workaround code invalid context try lookup child info,get_child_contexts() returns invalid contexts when context path missing This problem was reported by partner.

Short term solution: # print debugging message when get_child_contexts() on contexts that do not have path or depth and return empty array # prevent deleting of system context Long term solution (new issue to be created): * prevent deleting of invalid contexts in UI * add CLI tool for diagnostics and rebuilding of context paths * add more debugging notices to inform admins that there is something wrong with contexts * add more debugging info for admins that try to insert data directly to database tables without rebuilding the contexts * maybe add workaround code for invalid contexts that tries to lookup children using some other info

"showfromothers / hidefromothers error shown strings are not present but uses_sections is false I have create a custom course format.  In this format my uses_sections functions returns false.

The problem only occurs in forms where the submitted value is being set as the initial value for the field when the form fails validation and is being redisplayed. Someone could potentially insert something malicious in the value field and have it executed when the page returns.    The reason we don't think this is exploitable is that it seems that the malicious code can only originate and execute on the same client.    However we did note that the Chrome XSS-Auditor blocked the code from executing ""because [the script's] source code was found within the request"".    We had a look to see where the problem is. It appears to be with the way the values for these form elements are filtered when server side validation of the form has failed. ""getCleanType"" is returning ""cleanhtml"" and ""raw"" for the editor and filemanager elements, respectively. ""clean_param"" with type PARAM_CLEANHTML is being applied to all three of the parameters for the editor, ""description_editor[text]"", ""description_editor[format]"" and ""description_editor[itemid]"", while the ""itemid"" and ""format"" parameters seem to only even contain integers.

The problem only occurs in forms where the submitted value is being set as the initial value for the field when the form fails validation and is being redisplayed. Someone could potentially insert something malicious in the value field and have it executed when the page returns. The reason we don't think this is exploitable is that it seems that the malicious code can only originate and execute on the same client. However we did note that the Chrome XSS-Auditor blocked the code from executing ""because [the script's] source code was found within the request"". We had a look to see where the problem is. It appears to be with the way the values for these form elements are filtered when server side validation of the form has failed. ""getCleanType"" is returning ""cleanhtml"" and ""raw"" for the editor and filemanager elements, respectively. ""clean_param"" with type PARAM_CLEANHTML is being applied to all three of the parameters for the editor, ""description_editor[text]"", ""description_editor[format]"" and ""description_editor[itemid]"", while the ""itemid"" and ""format"" parameters seem to only even contain integers. ""imagefile"" is being cleaned with type PARAM_RAW (the default when no setType has been specified). This could be a problem with other form element types - any element where setType is not specified, or when an insufficient filter type is specified and the field is not cleaned in some other way before being sent back to the client when there is a validation error."

"Improve behaviour of grader header, footer and sidebar on iOS 8 + IE This issue relates to jankiness of the grader report on IE and iOS 8 Beta 4 (Safari).    In iOS versions < 8, the scroll event is only fired at the end of the action, and not throughout so this is not an issue.  From iOS 8 (tested with beta 4 on Safari), the scroll event is fired throughout. However, it is not fired frequently enough, resulting in a stuttering feeling.    IE just sucks at tables and with a large table in the DOM, it stutters without any javascript at all.

"Recycle Bin - deleting large complex objects forces user to wait With the recycle bin enabled, deleting large, complex objects forces the user to wait until the backup process has completed before they can do anything else. When you delete small objects (e.g., labels, simple pages), the deletion occurs quickly. By ""deletion,"" I mean this workflow:    1.  Turn editing on  2.  Delete item  3.  Turn editing off    But when you delete a larger, complex object, step 3 above -- turning editing off -- can take a long time ( up to > 2 minutes), and there is no indication (other than what the browser provides) that something is happening. You basically have to wait for it to finish. Something that used to happen immediately -- turning editing off after deleting something (regardless of its complexity) -- can take minutes with the Recycle Bin enabled. An example of a ""large, complex object"" is a quiz with 95 questions and 155 student responses. Obviously, Moodle is working on backing up the quiz, and since it's rather complex (lots of responses), it takes time. The same thing happens on restore. Restoring this kind of quiz can take some time, but there isn't any kind of progress indicator to let the user know that something is happening and that it may take some time.    The concern here is that with the recycle bin enabled, a fundamental aspect of the Moodle experience has changed; i.e., deleting some objects no longer happens quickly if they are complex. How long it takes for Moodle to return control when turning editing back off after deleting an object depends on how large/complex that object is.

Create a script to compare all grades for a 57% letter boundary problem. Currently the upgrade step for checking if a course should be frozen with a 57%letter boundary problem only checks if the course has the potential that grades will be affected. It does not check individual grades to see if they are affected.    It's quite possible that courses will be flagged as frozen when they do not need to be.    This task is to create a script that can be used to check each grade and ensure that the course will only be frozen if there will definitely be a grade change.,2,MDL-55066,moodle,create script compare grade 57 letter boundary problem currently upgrade step check course freeze 57%letter boundary problem check course potential grade affect check individual grade affect possible course flag frozen need task create script check grade ensure course freeze definitely grade change,Create a script to compare all grades for a 57% letter boundary problem.
